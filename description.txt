This mod was "inspired" by Dota 2 on Steam. Check it out, its pretty fun.

The mod's goal is to add different weapons and skins from different Dota 2 heroes as well as abilities. You gain levels by defeating various bosses and (in the future) invasions/events.
It is a heavy work in progress.

== Changelog ==

Available heroes:
- Abaddon: Borrowed Time

- Shadow Fiend: Shadowraze (all three), Necromastery
