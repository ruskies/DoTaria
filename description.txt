This mod was "inspired" by Dota 2 on Steam. Check it out, its pretty fun.

The mod's goal is to add different weapons and skins from different Dota 2 heroes as well as abilities. You gain levels by defeating various bosses and (in the future) invasions/events.
It is a heavy work in progress.

The health ratio is 0.25 Terraria health per Dota health. Currently doesn't apply to damage.
The mana ratio is 0.375 Terraria mana per Dota mana. For example, Shadowraze is 33.75 mana.

== Changelog ==
